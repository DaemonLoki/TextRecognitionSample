# ScreenshotTextRecognitionSample


## Intention

I've modified the original repository to allow the choosing of a photo from the user's library. 

My ultimate goal is to recognize the text of an image shared from another application in order to associate useful metadata with that screenshot, such as the timestamp of a YouTube video, perhaps the URL if it can be ascertained, a deep link, etc. 

## Originally from https://github.com/DaemonLoki/TextRecognitionSample

In this little app I demonstrate how to use the [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) framework on iOS to do on-device Text Recognition and Document Scanning. If you'd like to see a demo video, see below:
